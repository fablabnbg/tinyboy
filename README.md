Working with a tinyboy fabricator 1.0 + 1.5

Ideas
=====
* Large bottom fan cools all.
* Y-Motor gets air-duct or own fan mounted.
* oled or lcd display controller
* X-Bed extension to full 15cm travel within the 15cm cabinet
* Extended rear feet at the acrylc cabinet, so that it can carry a 1kg spool without tipping.
* Lipo block battery compartment for mobile use.
* Mount inexpensive OrangePI Lite with Wlan-Support, or similar
